# Vibration-PINNs


This repository presents a series of analysis on the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks in vibrational systems. The limitation of PINNs in learning such systems is discussed and the potential solutions are investigated. Specifically, the following topics are covered:

*   Free Vibration of a damped translational System (mass-spring-damper)
*   Effect of system parameters' magnitude on the performance of PINNs (to be added)
*   PINNs shortfalls in learning long temporal domains and the potential solutions (to be added)

Codes are developed using JAX library (https://github.com/google/jax)
